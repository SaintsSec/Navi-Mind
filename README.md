## üöÄ About Navi Mind

Springboarding off of advice from multiple people, we have come to one resounding understanding. In order to better secure AI. We need to build it ourselves.
Mind is SSG's crack at this undertaking. Building from the ground up on PyTorch we intend Mind to be the main driving AI behind Navi.

### üåç The Imperative of Open Source in AI & Cybersecurity

In the rapidly evolving domains of AI and cybersecurity, open source stands as a beacon of collaborative innovation. The transparency inherent in open-source projects offers a platform for collective problem-solving, allowing experts from diverse backgrounds to collaboratively tackle complex challenges. This communal approach accelerates advancements and ensures robustness in solutions.

For AI projects like Navi, open source provides an ecosystem where models and techniques are continually refined, reviewed, and validated by the global community. In cybersecurity, transparency is crucial. Open source tools undergo rigorous scrutiny, often leading to more secure and reliable solutions. Adopting an open-source ethos, as Navi has, aligns with the commitment to harness collective intelligence for building secure, efficient, and cutting-edge AI tools.
